# homesensorpackage

A basic home automation climate/light sensor using BME680 and VEML7700 sensors, controlled by an ESP8266 board. Data is transmitted as JSON packets over MQTT (will need a running MQTT broker)

Materials:
- NodeMCU Amica ESP8266
- STEMMA QT BME680
- Adafruit VEML7700 I2C Lux Sensor
- Wire/connectors
- 3D printed enclosure
